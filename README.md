**Hello there!**

I just wanted to share a quick side project creating a Spotify bot by puppeteer. <br>
According to the high interest of 'buying' clicks on social media, I set my mind on creating my own solution.  <br>
This is just for educational purposes! <br>
Please be aware that Spotify could ban at any point the used Spotify accounts or the artist accounts you have in your playlist! <br>

How to setup:
```javascript
npm init

npm install puppeteer dotenv
```

How to use:
```javascript
node bot.js
```
Be aware to add .env file with SPOTIFY_USERNAME, SPOTIFY_PASSWORD, SPOTIFY_PLAYLIST and optional CHROME_PATH.

Have fun!
